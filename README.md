# Toggl Track macOS Application

## ❓ What's up?

We've finally released the BETA for our fully native macOS app. 🎉 

## 🧰 How can you help?

This repository will serve as an additional hub for user feedback during the BETA testing and beyond!
You can find the official Toggl public feedback discussions for the macOS by going to [Discussions tab](https://github.com/toggl/track-macos-feedback/discussions). These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Toggl product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#-making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

If you encountered a bug, we recommend reaching out to our support team via the App Menu -> Help -> Send Feedback.

## 💡 Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/toggl/track-macos-feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our product. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.
